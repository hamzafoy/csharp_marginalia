## C# Development Stack

1. *Microsoft .NET* is required as a platform to run C# programs.
2. C# specific compiler & linker.
3. A proper development environment such as *Microsoft Visual Studio*.
*Do **NOT** confuse Microsoft Visual Studio with VSCode.*


## Defining 'Project' & "Solution' in C# parlance

a. A `project` is a codebase that produces a single **assembly**. An **assembly** is an executable file or
DLL file.
b. A `solution` is essentially multiple projects that are making up an entire application or have a unified 
intended use. Solutions can contain separate projects that contain application logic, dependencies, imported
libraries, and testing suites.

You can expect Microsoft Visual Studio to ask for a name for both **project** and **solution** each time you
generate a new repository, but you have the option to give them the same name and store them in the same directory
especially if you are working on single **projects**.
