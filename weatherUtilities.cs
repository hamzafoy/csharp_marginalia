/*

- It is common to have 1 class per file and for the filename and the class name
to be the same.

- Namespaces help with name clashes between classes.

- You can import and alias namespaces like so:
`using WeatherUtilities = MyUtilities.WeatherUtilities;

- `System` is the namespace that contains very fundamental methods, classes, including
the access to the Console.
